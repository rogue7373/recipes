## Ingredients
- 2 large chicken breasts
- Salt & Pepper
- 1/4 teaspoon garlic powder
- Flour
- 1 tablespoon olive oil
- 3 tablespoons butter
- 1/2 cup dry white wine
- 1/3 cup chicken broth
- 1 pinch Herbs de Provence (or Italian seasoning)
- 1/2 cup heavy whipping cream
- Chopped fresh parsley, for serving

## Instructions
1. Cut your chicken breasts in half lengthwise to make 4 thinner cutlets. Sprinkle them with salt and pepper and garlic powder, then dredge them in flour so they’re nicely coated.
2. Add the olive oil and 1 tablespoon of the butter to a skillet over medium-high heat. Once the pan is hot, add the chicken and cook for 4-5 minutes/side until golden. Take the chicken out of the pan and set aside (chicken shouldn’t be fully cooked yet).
3. Add the wine and chicken broth to the pan and let it bubble for about a minute. Stir to scrape up any bits from the bottom of the pan.
4. Add the remaining butter and Herbs de Provence to the pan, and continue simmering for another 2 minutes.
5. Add the cream and the chicken back into the pan. Reduce the heat to medium and cook for another 5 minutes or until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickend up a bit. Season with extra salt & pepper as needed and sprinkle with fresh parsely if using.
